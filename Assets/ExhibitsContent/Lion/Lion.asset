  description: Leul (Panthera leo) este o specie de felina carnivora, originara din
    regiunile Africii subsahariene si, intr-o mica masura, din vestul Indiei. Este
    un pradator de varf si se distinge prin comportamentul social complex, traind
    in grupuri organizate numite haite. Masculii sunt usor de recunoscut datorita
    coamei impunatoare.

  geographicRange: African lions (Panthera leo) live in most of sub-Saharan Africa
    except in desert and rainforest habitats. Lions were once exterminated from South
    Africa, where they remain in Kruger and Kalahari Gemsbok National Parks and possibly
    some other protected areas.
  habitat: African lions live in plains or savanna habitat with a large prey base
    (mostly ungulates) and sufficient cover available. In these optimal habitats,
    lions are the second most abundant large predator, after spotted hyenas Crocuta
    crocuta. Lions can also live, with wider ranges, in most habitats except in tropical
    rainforests and in deserts. Lions can live in forested, shrubby, mountainous,
    and semi-desert habitats.
  lifespan: Female lions typically live longer than males. Males reach their prime
    between five and nine years but few males survive past ten years of age. Some
    males have survived until 16 in the wild. Females normally live until 15 or 16
    years. In the Serengeti, females live up to 18 years.
  food: Lions are predatory carnivores. They usually hunt in groups, but the actual
    killing is done by an individual lion. They frequently bring down prey much bigger
    than they are themselves. Showy males have more difficulty hunting than females
    because of their conspicuousness, therefore females in a pride do the majority
    of hunting.
